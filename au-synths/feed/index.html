		<description><![CDATA[Interesting article John!

We are blessed with so many great synths on iOS. The combination of your detailed reviews and Doug Woods&#039;  &quot;thesoundtestroom&quot; YouTube demo videos is essential to make good purchase decisions.

I think I&#039;m synthed out - how many more do I need?

These days I&#039;m looking to innovative apps like Replicant2 or IAPs with great content to spend my $$$s.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Toz....  thanks for that. Yes, there are a number of other, also good, options when it comes to AU-ready iOS synths....  The cupboard is not, however, quite so full in some other categories.....  :-(  Hopefully, that will change soon....  very best wishes, John]]></description>

I&#039;d like to add that the developer, Blamsoft, came on to the iOS scene with nothing but AU apps; so Viking Synth certainly could have been mentioned here.  Along with iSem, Viking is one of the most used synths in my iOS tool chest.]]></description>
