		<description><![CDATA[Hi Peter...  I can do this using my iRig Pro and Amplitube....  I simply run Amplitube...  then switch to the iTunes Music Player app (at which point Amplitube goes silent on me), select the playlist, album or track I want and set it playing in the Music Player, and then flip back to Amplitube at which point it springs back into life again and I can play along....  Does that not work at your end?  Best wishes, John]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I have amplitude and iRig  It&#039;s good enough for practicing  but you have to load songs into the app music library one song at a time to play along with them. Is there an amp sim app that sounds good, works with iRig and can play along with songs from iPhone music player while playing guitar? 
Thanks]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I can really recommend an inexpensive, fully featured home recording solution, which includes real power once we talk about audio recording - it&#039;s name is REAPER.
How many channels you will need depends on the number of speakers you 
want. Some will more often than not default for the local physical 
electronics super chain.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Joe, no, not all have MIDI. For example, Mobile POD doesn&#039;t (as far as I&#039;m aware)....   It sounds great but I really hope Line 6 don&#039;t leave it hanging as just a Sonic Port-only app. I&#039;m sure they could sell some good numbers if they created an IAP to bypass the need for using their own hardware.  Best, John.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[No sound for the JamUp portion on VID 3? 

Bias portion has dound.  I know JamUp would put the others to shame, so that&#039;s probably to be fair to them.  ;).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Dude, you have some seriously fast freaking shredding fingers.  :-)

Very nice - thanks for the comparison.  I have most of these, and my favorite is the Bias/Jamup combo.  The one I don&#039;t have is the Mobile Pod, and it sounds great too.  

Really all of these can do a nice job if you buy all the options and spend the time to dial them in to your tastes I guess.

Do all of them have MIDI control?  I know JamUp does.  That might be a factor if you want to use them live, or even kick on some pedal while doing a recording.  Amplitube and JamUp also have some additional studio/recording features.  That might be a consideration for some.]]></description>
