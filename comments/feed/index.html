		<description><![CDATA[Hi John,
I&#039;m a bit late with this post but I still check in here from time to time to see if you&#039;ve posted anything. I came into the iOS music app buying craze just as it was getting going and my two favorite sites were MAB and The Sound Test Room. It makes me smile to think about ALL those wonderful apps (that I STILL use) and the times we all had waiting for the next great app. More than just great apps and great music being made with them, the whole &quot;epoch&quot; was so much fun! It was one of those eras that will likely never be repeated, at least not to the degree that this was. My buddy and I refer to this as the &quot;Animoog&quot; era ;) I hope you continue to post to this blog and perhaps a few new groundbreaking apps  come about in the mean time. I wish you all the best and Thank You for the years that you have been a BIG voice in the  iOS music app era. I feel like I know you ;)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[AUDIO EVOLUTION is a DAW uniquely available on 5 popular operating platforms :Amiga, Windows, Mac OSX, Android and now IOS.

Like Protools, learn iit on one platform and transfer your knowledge to any platform any where in the world : and virtually all of it developed one guy in a country not known for its music app success —- and in his spare timre.

Bravo !]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Ed....  thanks for the kind words.....  Yep, I&#039;d have kicked myself later if I&#039;d not taken up some of the new opportunities I was presented with.....  but I do hope I can keep a flicker of things alive here on occasion....  and who knows what my work situation will be like in 6-12 months....  so I&#039;ll never say never....  Very best wishes, John]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi, I have just purchased Cubasis V2.4 (32 Bit)  for my I Pad 2  (iOS 9.3.5)
Every time I try to edit data (notes etc) it crashes and throws me out of the program.
Is there anything I can do - as not very impressed as I purchased this to supplement my workflow on PC

Many thanks - Gerald Bellot]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I have been experimenting with TC-Performer for a week or so, and agree the multi-touch gestural interface is making much more intelligent use of the iPad as a performance tool.   Once you have expanded to the maximum functionality through in-app-purchases, there is not mention of an upgrade path to TC-11.   If as it appears TC-Performer is really TC-11 with some features disabled this does not seem quite right to me.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[B-I-A-B would, I think, work well on an iPad....   It&#039;s quite a while since I used it and perhaps my main observation from memory would be that the GUI is a touch on the busy side to work on a smaller iPad screen.....  Still, it would be interesting to see :-) . Very best wishes, John]]></description>
