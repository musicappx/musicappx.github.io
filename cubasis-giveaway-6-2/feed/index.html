		<description><![CDATA[Hi Eric,
thanks for the kind words. I do mix and match between mobile and desktop for my production work in various ways. If I get some downtime between projects then I&#039;ll see if I couldn&#039;t put together a post of the topic to share....   Thanks again and very best wishes, John]]></description>
