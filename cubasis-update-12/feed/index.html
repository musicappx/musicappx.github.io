		<description><![CDATA[Alex, Uh , I forgot to agree with the Garage band recomendation, its free and simple to start, many like it and the alchemy synth inside it is an old favorite for many, but garageband is too focussed on non musicians and keeping everything minimal and easy, thats nice for a while but cubasis is a powerful app, its not just simple and powerful but its also complete and capable, fact the majority of electronic music we know and love made prior to  around 2000 was made on technology far less powerful and far less user friendly.   Sequencing on a touch device is this piano players dream come true, cubasis and gadget are the best for having easy to use sequencer grids , cubasis has powerful routing of signals and fx and works well with audio interfaces such as iconnectivity audio4+   ( i got the 2+ but traded it in for 4+)  this lets you run two ipads together or one ipad and one pc, there are complex signal routing of both audio and midi from an app interface and its all done inside the audio interface not the computer, plus 8 midi controllers  and 4 audio ins and 4outs, this with a mixing board of 12 channels would be a professional grade setup with newest most powerful most capable options currently available as far as i know.     There are lots of other devices from iconnectivity, but you will need that word glossary or a mentor friend with knowledge to help get it setup, its not very simple and rather confusing BUT  wow, my system became soooooo flexible and powerful when i got that thing.      Two ipads together really make its fun, i will continue to buy new ipads before my old ipads are half used so i will always have multiple devices.....]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Alex, I totally understand this frustration, it took me a long time to wrap my brain around many concepts in music production, theory, timing layering etc.   I recomend you print out an online list of music production terminology definitions, here is a nice one...    https://www.recordingconnection.com/glossary/

Re the loudness issue....
https://www.gearslutz.com/board/electronic-music-instruments-and-electronic-music-production/817758-synths-output-too-low.html

Regarding getting your piano loud, the output of any instrument coming into a device such as the ipad gets converted from  analog to digital , there is an ideal level you need to be at. Same with the output of any software to software or software out to a hardware recorder.  The less extra stuff between sound source and recorder the better.  I believe a compresser should help, my knowledge is little on this topic but i looked it up on gearsluts, hope this helps.  There is a bunch of info provided here that should help you.  And yes, cubasis is awesome, keep an eye on korg gadget though, its reallllly intuitive and the workflow of Gadget is the best for keeping it simple and just working well so you can focuss on composing.  There is also the Bluetooth keyboard controller the Korg Nanokeystudio, its wirefree and gets about 5 hours on 2 rechargable AA batteries, reallllly nice for busses, trains and parks!  the Gadget app was made together with the nanokeystudio so nothing beats it for simple.  And output recordings sound real good as is.    Both Cubasis and Gadget would be recomended purchases.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Alex, GarageBand that comes free with your iPad would probably suit all your needs. It comes with some decent digital pianos included. You could record your existing instrument if you add a audio/midi interface. Steinberg make one for about $120 and it includes a free 4 track version of Cubasis.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I see one drawback in your articles. You write for users, who have already experience in this field, who know all these terminologies and purposes of these plugins etc. But for new users, who want to try this first time, there&#039;s almost nothing understandable here. It&#039;s like reading in different language.

I have digital piano. I want to record myself. Just solo piano sound (I don&#039;t care about mixes etc). I want to bring my piano recording to best possible quality and especially I want to bring it to best maximum sound level possible (loud, when you don&#039;t need to bring your volume button until the end. I see so many digital piano recordings on YouTube, and most of them just too quiet). What I need? Is Cubasis OK for my purpose? Etc.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Can Cubasis explode a MIDI track to parts yet?  I remember that last time I used Cubasis you couldn’t and that was critical to what I was trying to do, so i’ve never actually fired the app back up since then.  Not saying it’s a bad program, just saying that’s the feature it is (or at least was) missing for me.]]></description>
