		<description><![CDATA[Hi Ed....  thanks for the kind words.....  Yep, I&#039;d have kicked myself later if I&#039;d not taken up some of the new opportunities I was presented with.....  but I do hope I can keep a flicker of things alive here on occasion....  and who knows what my work situation will be like in 6-12 months....  so I&#039;ll never say never....  Very best wishes, John]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi, I have just purchased Cubasis V2.4 (32 Bit)  for my I Pad 2  (iOS 9.3.5)
Every time I try to edit data (notes etc) it crashes and throws me out of the program.
Is there anything I can do - as not very impressed as I purchased this to supplement my workflow on PC

Many thanks - Gerald Bellot]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks very much for this update, John. I confess that, since this blog became sporadic, I’ve drifted back to working between my PC (Reaper, with mainly Waves &#038; Slate plugins) and my iPad with Auria, Aum and many of the plugins you’ve reviewed. I have to say that, soundwise, the tracks produced on my iPad stand up very well indeed against those made in my much more expensive PC software/plugins.

I hope you are well and enjoying life!]]></description>
