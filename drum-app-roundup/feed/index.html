		<description><![CDATA[Hello everyone, I am a sole/indie iOS developer and I am working on an app called DrumKnee 3D. It is still in the early access phase but I would like to know if you could check it out and provide feedback (good or bad ;)). The cool thing about DrumKnee is that you can rest the iPhone/iPad on your foot and the device will detect when you hit your foot on the ground, so it feels natural to play the bass drum. The link to the App Store is: https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1241682795?mt=8 You can find a couple of youtube videos I posted recently showing how it works: https://youtu.be/ECkPXP0wBMU]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Aloha, John &#038; all my iOS musician e-friends here!
Very comprehensive roundup, John, where DO you find the time?
I&#039;m settled on the Drum Loops HD apps, Audiobussing the skins into cubasis.
The furthest I&#039;ve gotten away from monotonous sleep inducing drum apps.
Very realistic acoustic audio, but rather limited on fills &#038; I can&#039;t find any snare roll ups.
Building my own, they suck, maybe practice will improve it.
Double-tracking gets REALLY kick in the shorts drums on tracks!
I&#039;m now trying to get my timing worked out, so as to track a modern rig &#038; 
then the vintage rig &#038; combine those.  
Too bad there&#039;s no meter/signature conformity on cubasis, I wonder why not?
Drum Loops HD2 sounds a lot different, (too different for the same record),
WAY LESS fills, &#038; overall, not nearly as flexible as DLHD1. 
I&#039;ll post again as I get things going further into the project her.
THX AGAIN, I LOVE this Web/Blog-Site!!!!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Nigel....   Sector is a brilliant app....  Maybe not one for everyone but for those that like to get experimental it can really deliver some great results....  and the element of statistical randomness in how it slices and dices loops means you always get some nice variations.....  Best wishes, John]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Great roundup, very comprehensive!

My own very keen interest is in getting something on the iPad that would replace something like EZDrummer as a sound library of acoustic drum sounds for the playing of an electronic drum set.  

Specifically, I want to play my Roland vdrums electronic drum set, send midi out to my iPad (via audio interface), and hear (appropriate to the pads hit) natural sounding acoustic drum sounds come out of the iPad (or monitors hooked up to the iPad).  These sounds should directly correspond to my playing, with little to no noticeable latency.  Also, a midi recording of my playing (via vdrums to audio interface to DAW app on the iPad) should be able trigger the same drum sounds and route them back to the DAW for an audio recording.  And of course, no machine gunning, please.

The sounds could actually be synthesized in origin if they were natural sounding enough (more natural than Roland, which already isn&#039;t that bad) and avoided machine gunning.  

With such an app in hand, err, in iPad, I would then be able to meet all my music production needs without resorting to a regular computer.  A modest dream, sure, but it&#039;s mine!  So, any news in this regard or reviews of drum apps with this kind of application in mind would be much appreciated, at least by me and surely by other edrummers out there.

Keep up the great work!]]></description>
