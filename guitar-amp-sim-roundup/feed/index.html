		<description><![CDATA[Hi Oliver....  guitar amp/rig modelling - and the comparison with the &#039;real deal&#039; (mostly valve) amps the models are based upon - is an interesting topic. There is loads of stuff on YouTube in this area including lots of folks comparisons models vs real amps and comparing different forms of modeller to see (hear) which sounds best....  Anyway, without wishing to add to the confusion, at some point in the not too distant future, I&#039;d love to do an audio comparison between (a) the various iOS amp modellers, (b) iOS software vs desktop software, (c) iOS modellers and high-end hardware modellers (e.g. the Line 6 Helix), (d) modelling software vs dedicated modelling amps and (e) any form of modelling vs a tube amp or two....   And round it all off with a &#039;blind test&#039;....   just various audio clips that could have been produced with any of this technology and see what folks think they can hear....  In a recording context, I don&#039;t think the majority of listeners would be able to reliably play &#039;spot the valve amp&#039;. However, as a player, when &#039;in the room&#039; with a valve amp and a modelling device (of any sort) then maybe it&#039;s easier to identify exactly what&#039;s what? And part of that is certainly the detail of the response you get to different playing dynamics....

Of the various iOS sims, I tend to stick with BIAS FX and Mobile POD. I like the geeky side of the BIAS FX/BIAS Amp combination and I&#039;ve always been a fan of Line 6 stuff (which would not do my credibility with some of the YouTube metal crowd much good as there do seem to be a lot of folks who are not such fans)....

Anyway, good luck with your tone hunt for that perfect iOS &#039;Vox&#039; sound....  very best wishes, John]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks John for your great overview of existing apps!
I just bought an iTrack Dock was wondering, if it can replace my Line 6 Pod HD 500. Unfortunately it can&#039;t ;) 
It looks I like the Line 6 sound as some others do . I compared my Pod HD 500 to NI Guitar Rig and 3 guitar apps for the iPad. I mostly use clean/crunchy sounds, and I especially like the VOX model to create that tone, so I compared the Line 6 VOX with Guitar Rig, BIAS FX, Amplitude and Mobile Pod. No one of the other apps could deliver what the POD does: It gives you incredible feedback of how you &quot;attack&quot; the strings - if you treat them hard, it sounds different to when you treat them softly - that&#039;s how it should be, that&#039;s why we love tube amps!
Amplitude could deliver a good &quot;VOX&quot; sound, but the number of effects is disappointing, no Reverb, what? Then I bought Bias Amp to pimp the VOX sound of Bias FX. I think it got more into the direction I wanted it to sound, but to be honest, I rather did not know, what I was doing. Unfortunately Line 6&#039;s Mobile POD is rather disappointing compared to their (PRO) hardware. The possibilities are limited and the sounds are weak. If Line 6 would transport the quality of the sounds of the Pod HD 500 to an iPad app, THIS would be an instant buy!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Great roundup, John - really helpful snapshot of the current options available to the iOS guitarist. I recently purchased a Line 6 Sonic Port VX, so I now have the mobilePOD app available. Your comments piqued my interest, so I may need to go exploring.

Just wanted to put in a shout for JamUp Pro - It also integrates with BIAS amp, and allows for downloading modded amps from their &quot;tonecloud.&quot; I have a few favorite amp models I&#039;ve purchased, created and/or discovered. Their Blueline Ampeg amp IAP provides a very satisfying bass thug, I found a nice hotrodded Marshall cab for my metal tones on their tonecloud, shimmery clean tones via the app&#039;s Fender Twin counterpart, and built the mother of all acoustic bass amps using a MusicMan 8x10 cab and a souped-up Frankenstein head, both configured in BIAS Amp.

I know Positive Grid would like me to up my game and jump up to Bias FX, but I&#039;m very happy with the sounds and rigs I get with JamUp, and it all incorporates nicely with my IK Blueboard and Moog Expression Pedal. So I&#039;m staying put for now (occasional foray into mobilePOD aside) until push comes to shove - i.e., PG drops support of JamUp - which I hope is still a ways off in the future :)

Hope you&#039;ll be sharing some fresh tones from the new studio soon - Cheers!!

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the run-down on all these amps. No matter what you think of the various pricing strategies of these developers, any one of these solutions is a heck of a deal price-wise once you&#039;ve gotten over the hump of an iPad, a guitar interface and a guitar. I have an amp sitting in the basement that I&#039;m about ready to throw up on Craigslist (not sure if you have that in the UK) to some budding young guitarist for cheap money. I just can&#039;t believe the sounds you can get for a fraction of the cost -- and since I am always playing through headphones to keep the Mrs. happy anyway, might as well do it through an iPad.

My app of choice is Tone Stack with the Motherload 2.0 IAP. Cheers.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think it would be good to speak a little about performance too - how these apps perform if you&#039;re actually trying to use them as an amp +FX replacement. my Ipad is not the latest (4th gen) but has been a very effective music producing machine until I tried (and paid for) Bias FX - I can&#039;t do anything &#039;fun&#039; with it, unless I increase the latency setting so much that I can&#039;t play it anymore. 
Mobile POD - I have used Line6 amp simulators (hardware and software) for many years now, but the app really loses it&#039;s value as there&#039;s no remote control function. I&#039;m assuming any guitarist these days will want to switch sounds without the need to stop playing, right? the fact that mobile POD has no (midi) remote control is just strange. Unless they don&#039;t really want it to compete with their hardware.
Jamup -I used Jamup at a few gigs - it&#039;s good and simple to use, with live usage quite well thought out, but to me the sound is not the best.
For now ToneStack is my favourite - it sounds good, and, very importantly, doesn&#039;t use as many resources as BIAS so you can play with low latency. (correction: you can _play_) 
Using few resources is not just relevant if you&#039;re on an older Ipad - it&#039;s also relevant if you&#039;re on the latest, because sooner or later you&#039;ll want to run other apps at the same time. more FX, background tracks, recording..]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Great writeup, thanks John!

I was wondering, what&#039;s your take on the guitar amp and effects modelling built into GarageBand, compared to these apps?

Thanks!]]></description>
