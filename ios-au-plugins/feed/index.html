		<description><![CDATA[It is this nonconformity, not only in Format but also in unidentifiable and non-standard symbols which has meant that ever since the iPad one, I haven&#039;t managed to compose any music whatsoever with iOS. It&#039;s just become to difficult for my old brain.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[AU support for Model 15 and Korg Mono/Poly.  The gadget closed system means I find I either write things exclusively with Korg synths in gadget, or completely exclude Korg while using AU in Auria Pro with Zeeon and Bram Bos AU plugins. A meeting point on all of those would be amazing.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[AU *host* support in BeatHawk. Primarily for sampling of single AU sources (cf. BeatMaker 3 but keeping it simple(r)?), especially considering that its current input modes (i.e. mic/external pretty much) have always felt quite limiting. And as a bonus, just being able to bypass/replace the built-in delay+reverb FX with 1+1 hosted AUs would be extremely useful, even if no other major changes were made to the workflow or related UI. My 20 cents, considering that I love the streamlined and fast workflow of BeatHawk, while feeling a bit constrained by the walled gardens present in the app and OS. Keeping my fingers crossed wrt Files in iOS 11 opening the latter up a bit though... (?)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Daniel....  thanks for that...  and, yes, a mono-timbral version of SampleTank for AU iOS would be a cool idea....  and undoubtedly easier to manage with multiple instances rather than a single instance running multiple sounds. IKM are obviously familiar with the desktop plugin formats so you would imagine that the expertise is there....  More a question of the resources and the likely returns they think might see I guess....  best wishes, John]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I do wonder if there is a small case for still keeping on the old non-plugin formats. One thing that occurred to me for example is that there is at least one app on OSX/PC that isnt a plugin - Band In A Box - that i&#039;d love to be able to operate in an IAA fashion on OSX - kind of like ReWire does when communicating with a DAW. 
Ableton also operates like this when &quot;hosted&quot; inside a DAW. Both BIAB and Ableton are of course - much more than simple audio generators or MIDI &quot;filters&quot; so arguably dont fit the AudioUnit paradigm.... but i&#039;m open to persuasion on that. 

Another reason for maybe retaining IAA etc ( apart from backward compatibility) might simply be the desire to keep &quot;big&quot; apps that normally take a while to launch and &quot;load up&quot; - continually in RAM - simply getting rerouted to different DAW type hosts ( or AUM ) as needed.  Since a plugin i&#039;m pretty sure - gets its process killed - it quits - once its host is exited. 

Dunno.

On OSX it has only ever been Band In A Box that I dreamt would eventually get something like IAA support for IAA hosting inside a DAW... so maybe just going full-on for AU and deprecating IAA/AudioBus in the long run is the wiser route. 

DUNNO.

Oh - and as for that single app - I vote for SampleTank - redesigned so that instead of being multitimbral - each AU instance just has a single ST instrument - picked out of the ST arsenal. 

Multitibral plugins ( ie multichannel ) to me are always a right pain to set up in DAWs.]]></description>
