		<description><![CDATA[There is a great DAW that you didn&#039;t mention called Multitrackstudio(MTS) for iPad, by Giel Bremmers. It is a solid app that supports AU, MIDI, IAA etc. It has great sounds and it&#039;s own effects. It supports recording multiple simultaneous tracks and all the professional stuff. The interface is well done and easy to use but not fancy and flashy. Who needs fancy. I need good apps that don&#039;t crash all the time. This one is a winner. It also has a separate remote control app. I am surprised you left it out. I think it is an important one. I think Multitrack DAW that you did review is a great oldie but the combination of MTS AND MTS Remote is way better in every way.
There is also FL Studio which is interesting for FL Studio users on laptops and desktop computers.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Despite its goofy graphical interface  n-tracks is worthy of mention, i do not know the specifics of cubasis or beatmaker, please let my know?  but as far as i have experienced, it is the only DAW that allows simultaneous capture of at least 2 tracks of audio and midi, this is not the case with Meteor regrettably, aside from that its low cost and unique recording abilities makes it suitable for my needs of recording live.  honestly unless i was on a desert island with just an ipad, i would use a desktop or laptop to really get down to business, so Auria is a bit over the top for contemporary Ipad capabilities, , but lacking midi makes it pretty redundant for me ,  i have read about some issues with Cubasis, for that kind of money i would expect all those features and full functionality , love to know a bit about its capoabilities as far as multitrack audio and midi]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think Yamaha&#039;s &quot;Mobile Music Sequencer&quot; is outstanding for musical composition and ideas sketching in realtime on the iPhone or iPad. It&#039;s very close to Ableton Live-- and actually better in many respects.  This is the hidden jewel in the rough. Can&#039;t believe I waiting this long to try it. I just never could find much info on it! Yes it looks quirky, but it&#039;s features, once understood, open up words of ease and composing joy. For example input a rhythmic vamp just once and then porgram that automatically into a chord progression that you can keep tailoring.  Mix and match phrases from different sections and create new ones from what works.  And more!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Very nice post. A few more variables to consider are 1) the instruments you are playing (and to a lesser extent the style), 2) the device you&#039;re using to record and 3) where you&#039;re going next. 

If you&#039;re looking for drums, piano and organ to compliment guitar and vocal tracks, Garageband provides everything you need and is convenient, easy to use and (now) free. It supports 16 to 32 tracks now too.  The big winner for Garageband though is the Smart Drummer. This makes creating drum backing tracks easy, fast and fun. You can then replace or augment them with additional tracks to complete the drums.

Also If you&#039;re going to be recording on iPhone and iPad, again Garageband is a great choice Multitrack is also good, but doesn&#039;t have MIDI or the convenient instruments. 

If you&#039;re like me, you have a quality laptop and something like Logic Pro X that&#039;s also useful for mobile recording. Again Garageband is a good choice here because it supports iCloud making it extremely easy to share content. Garageband on Mavericks is also free now, and has been rebuilt as a subset of Logic Pro X, which itself have come down in price significantly.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[No Nanostudio? I know that it&#039;s audio capabilities are pretty limited, but I think it would be worth mentioning for it&#039;s sophisticated MIDI capabilities, quality of it&#039;s synthesizer and flexibility of its drum pad interface.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Great review.  I use different apps for recording for different needs.  From GB to Meteor, each has a great tool box.  I&#039;m holding out on Auria.  I&#039;ve got a question.  Can you provide direction about learning MIDI.  I&#039;m old school and want to be sure I&#039;m up to date on using MIDI within ios environment.  Back in the day there were a lot of cables and a lot of external devices.  But these days so much is internal.  I&#039;ve recently purchased the iConnectivity2+ because I want to use my iOS device with an external keyboard while being able to keep my ios device charged courtesy the iConnectiviy.  So I&#039;m curious about updating my info on MIDI.  I suspect there are a few changes.
thanks,
Martin]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Glen...  thanks :-) There are one or two other DAW apps out there that I could add to the the list at some stage when I get a chance.
BTW, just about to update the section on Auria given the release today of IAA support....
Best wishes,
John]]></description>
