		<description><![CDATA[Talking about GarageBand, is it possible to use it as an Audio (instead of MIDI) sequencer for my digital piano? I mean, I need sequencer for my digital piano, which doesn&#039;t have sequencer. And I want to record sounds (audio) of my digital piano.

So, long time passed since that article. Interesting, what would you say about iPad Pro 12.9&quot; for example with its screen and enormously increased power.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Striz...  thanks for taking the time to comment. Your experience is one I&#039;ve heard others express also - that sometimes, a top-flight desktop music production system just provides too many choices - and the creative flow gets sidetracked by trying endless combinations of things that eventually lead nowhere. Maybe the somewhat more limited palette offered via an iPad or iPhone is good in that respect? That said, I&#039;m also with you that there is no absolute need to see the two levels of technology as separate platforms that can not interact. I use my iPad as a sound source for my desktop system just as you describe...  and I also run a virtual control surface on it to act as a remote for Cubase. Keep making music and keep reading :-)  best wishes, John]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Great article. I started making music in the days of the tascam 4 tracks days ( when going to a 24 track studio was way out of my budget) , then getting into sequencing keyboard workstations, and eventually seeing my studio grow into a decent mid level studio with a Mackie 24 channel analog mixing board, outboard gear, then going into the digital multitrack recorders like adats, the Roland vs800, and finally getting a Mac, running digital performer, Logic and a ton of virtual instruments and effects, gigs of sound libraries and samples, and sometimes just have too many options to chose from. While I enjoyed having any sound I wanted ! It sometimes felt like a blessing and a curse. And sometimes I actually missed just committing to the sound I wanted and just recording it to tape, vs midi. Yes I still have my desktop studio, but I got an Ipad a year ago and I&#039;m using my desktop less and less. I have several Daws, drum machines, amp simulators, synths, that I don&#039;t miss being tied down to my desktop studio at all. And now when I do decide to work on the Mac! my ipad is right there in the loop. Instead of recording my part via midi,  where the temptation to quantize everything is always there  I&#039;m just recording the sounds from my ipad instruments to an audio track. While I do lose the flexibility that midi offers I feel more like I&#039;m capturing the moment for what it is, committing to the sound I&#039;m using. I having abandoned midi all together, I still record some songs that way, but the ipad has given me a really great option of finding a great synth sound, amp sounds or what ever and just going with it and committing.]]></description>
