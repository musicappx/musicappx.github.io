		<description><![CDATA[When I put out my first app - SrutiBox - in late August 2008, it was hard to think of what price to go in with. (Hey, I have a new iOS8/iphone 5,6,6+ version of SrutiBox waiting for review right now). I think there was already a low price precedent, and though I think this was a few months before SMULE&#039;s Ocarina, it was pretty quickly perceived that an app store app - music app at least - was going to be at a Tier 1 price point. But it was also obvious that that price was ridiculously low. People were just vacuuming up apps, hating them, and leaving the kind of comments one reserves for your political bugbears, inedibly on the app store pages, practically the only place to discover apps. So I priced it in Tier 3, where it has stayed all these years, figuring it would cut down on the impulse buyers, and maybe create an impression of quality by requesting to be paid, even though it&#039;s  less than I typically tip for lunch.
It&#039;s hard for a single programmer with no budget for publicity to move those virtual units. My apps&#039; audiences are not particularly apt to promote them socially.  
Then Audio Copy and Paste and Audiobus came along. What these APIs provide is their own, mini versions of the AppStore, where synth apps can be separated from others in Apple&#039;s music category like education, tuning, band promo and radio apps. This really helps the visibility, but they don&#039;t have ratings systems built in them.  I actually suggested at one point that there be a kind of agreement that no audiobus app would be priced less than Tier 5, (and allow for occasional sales price cuts)  so that people could understand that they would pay a little more for the ability to interoperate. That&#039;s something like your option (2).  This was shot down immediately as potentially illegal ( in Europe at least) as a price fixing scheme, which I completely understand. Nevertheless, these low prices are really , really low.

I&#039;m glad to see packages now in the App store, I&#039;m curious to see if a scheme like Patrick Secret Base describes will pass muster at Apple, since Apple has been trying to cut down on &quot;redundant&quot; apps in the app store. Every app should be a working app, all the time, no matter how &quot;lite&quot;, so this weekly time limit thing seems really close to the edge of acceptability.  There have been weird and arbitrary decisions in the past, like not allowing MIDI as a paid add-on.

Increasing the user base would obviously be a great solution. Most people don&#039;t even know how sophisticated the iOS music app ecosystem is. If the devices get a little beefier, and there are good interfaces for professional I/O, it could really put a dent in the professional music making world. My apps would probably remain marginal, they are not really for casual users and are somewhat closer to art pieces or acoustic though experiment tools, a new form of interactive media that itself is trying to find a price level. 

But this whole app ecosystem may change as iOS and OSX grow together and for all I know will become a single OS, supporting apps under OS X by making a consumer version of the simulator or something like that. Then I&#039;d expect desktop apps to start racing to the bottom as well.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Just a quick note on subscription models. As a creative professional, I can tell you the pro design community by and large were VERY unhappy when Adobe announced their &quot;subscribe or hit the bricks&quot; strategy with Creative Suite. Ditto for a fair amount of Microsoft Office users with this whole Office 365 model.

Successful subs beyond magazines typically have two things in common: they think they&#039;re the only game in town (think of your local cable provider) and their insistence that you either feed at their trough like the rest or starve breeds consumer resentment (think of your local cable provider). I would balk at any iOS music app announcing they were going subscription-only.

Finally, it seems logical that at some point users reach a subscription saturation point. Is it realistic to expect users to track and manage 50+ music app monthly or even annual statements? On top of their Hulu and Netflix? Would new developers/apps find it difficult to break through a user&#039;s established subscription bubble?

I prefer the smorgasbord. Best way to make it the most profitable buffet in town is to make it the most visible buffet in town. Grow the user base and everyone benefits.

PS - pleased to see so many developers weigh in! It adds insight and helps center the conversation. Thank you all! And thank you John for such a thoughtful article.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[A very interesting and encouraging discussion. It&#039;s great to see people who care about the future of apps (be they music or otherwise).

A few thoughts and observations:

1) The mass market consumer generally does not want to pay anything, let alone Â£0.79. They think that Facebook or Apple pay to make all the good apps. This therefore renders option (4) (sell more copies) less likely to me. Our music practice app Soundproof (http://getsoundproof.com) is free with in-app purchases and we&#039;ve had a major publication&#039;s reviewer feature us and then complain that practice is limited to 30 minutes per week without paying a one-off Â£1.49! As fellow developers here will know, that kind of attitude can make months of work feel like an utter waste of time.

2) Time limited trial where it stops after a time is, to my knowledge, not permitted by Apple. An app must continue to function as per the App Store Guidelines... see:

... 2.9 Apps that are &quot;demo&quot;, &quot;trial&quot;, or &quot;test&quot; versions will be rejected. Beta Apps may only be submitted through TestFlight and must follow the TestFlight guidelines

... 11.9 Apps containing content or services that expire after a limited time will be rejected, except for specific approved content (e.g. films, television programs, music, books)

We have managed to get through app review (so far) with a weekly usage time limit, so people can use it in perpetuity and pay nothing, provided they can wait until next week to carry on.

I&#039;m not sure what the solution is. I am experimenting with in-app purchases for feature-bundles, on the basis that new categories of features will be added in future as separate purchases.

Paid upgrades are unlikely to work in the current system because there are complications with Apple&#039;s pricing tiers. We tried to offer in-app purchases for &quot;basic&quot; and &quot;advanced&quot;, with a hidden purchase tier to upgrade from one to the other in case you bought Basic first - so we could offer an upgrade to Advanced at no cost penalty. Sadly in many countries this is not viable as the pricing tiers are not proportional to those in other  countries. The result is you end up with a morass of per-territory pricing and upgrade price points or people get screwed if they buy at one level and try to upgrade to another. Similar problems exist with bundle pricing, in that it can cost more to get the bundle than buy the remaining apps you don&#039;t already have.

Basically, it&#039;s really tricky. I think long term subscription and/or selling more in-app content people actually want is the only model likely to be sustainable. Paid upgrades are unlikely to happen any time soon even with app bundles, and even if they do - the per-unit price is so low its going to be really hard. This is being borne out by the successful revenue generating titles being free with purchase for credits/add ons. Scummy as it may seem, most people prefer this model. Music apps obviously don&#039;t have to be scummy about it like games are.

In essence I like the idea we are left at: build an app that is your &quot;bricks and mortar&quot; and then sell stuff you create or curate from it. It&#039;s just a lot harder, and more risky, to design a whole business than just build an app.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I was using Nanostudio on my lunch in work the other day. Someone asked if I was making music on my iPhone. 
&quot;Yes&quot; I said. 
&quot;What&#039;s the app called?&quot; He asked. 
&quot;Nanostudio. It&#039;s really great&quot;. 
&quot;How much is it?&quot;
&quot;About Â£10&quot;
His eyes nearly popped out of his face. And nothing I said could convince him that Â£10 for an app was worth every penny. 

The scary thing about it is that if an app gets abandoned (and it&#039;s completely bug free at time of abandonment) its still not going to last forever. It&#039;s going to become obsolete when there is an iOS update in the future, or an Audiobus update. These apps aren&#039;t self contained anymore. 

I for one would definitely pay a little extra for apps, and I&#039;m also not against paying for major updates like you mentioned above. I&#039;d  even pay a yearly subscription for an app that I love. 

In some ways raising the price of apps would cause people to be more selective and it may mean some developers would lose out. This may separate the wheat from the chaff, but it may also mean losing some developers in the long run. 

Anyway, a great article that certainly gave me something to think about.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I love my iOS devices.  I am an app addict and blessed to beta test SO many awesome audio apps (from the big guys to the Indy Devs) and own too many too list. I  rarely complain about prices of apps because we are fortunate to be able to make some killer music on a small mobile platform.  

I would have never thought back in my high school days that my instruments could be simulated on a computer let alone a 1/4 lb device I can put in my bag and even my pocket!

Goodness know I love my analog hardware, my digi hardware, my software, and my apps.  I will never part with my studio gear (even if takes up a boatload of space).

We truly  have it made these days. 

I wish all the small Devs  that make affordable and awesome apps that are updated often (and priced fairly) would be able to have designing their own apps  be their main job and make a great living at it. 

It does drive me crazy that some (some) large companies make crappy apps that never get updated or are filled with bugs and they charge a hefty price.  I can think of one in particular that I have bought all the IAPs only for it to have one crappy update in the last 2.5 years and no Audiobus, IAP, or even Audio copy/paste in it!  

Those are the only apps I ever complain about.  I don&#039;t mine throwing down 40 or 50 bucks on an app  if it  blows my mind.  I do get bummed out if I spend that much and am not impressed (which has happened many times) but that won&#039;t deter me from buying  audio apps and still getting giddy when an awesome new app comes out!

Peace]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Good article showing the problems with funding a niche market. You can tell it&#039;s niche as a number 1 music app isn&#039;t anywhere near number 1 overall.
Developers create apps for two reasons imo 1) because they want to create something on an emerging platform that hasn&#039;t been done before and 2) yes we all want to give up our day jobs and play with creating music apps.
Realistically for me 2) will only happen if I keep releasing new apps (less effort to create as you can use an existing framework or library) rather than work on 1 and increase (and lower the volume) or decrease (raising the volume). I&#039;ve actually found reducing the price does not increase sales. People will buy your app - after all they spent $1000 on their ipad so collecting as many apps as possible is a must.
For 1) it&#039;s the only way a developer can survive at the moment - a labour of love. Compared to my day job I earn 5% of my salary of my day job on one app (which is more than I expected), and spend 70% of a 7 hour day doing that - not economic. 
The route I will take is 3) IAP - I&#039;ve release a base app with many functions, but if something larger comes along, its reasonable I think to charge additional for it.
I&#039;m finding 30% takeup on the IAP I created - probably low because of another issue (for developers) not mentioned in your article. Marketing. I spent $0 on marketing - but hope to increase this soon as word of mouth isn&#039;t good to spread beyond the 2000+ IOS musicians we have here.
So for an indie developer (without the contacts the big companies already have), the biggest problem is deciding how much revenue to spend on marketing. That worries me as we are still niche - take all the profit out of it and it goes sour - developer leaves and focuses on other more lucrative areas that aren&#039;t really serious but generate alot of money...

I for one have many designs I want to see on the ipad to support the music I create, so will continue to do so....]]></description>

Developers create apps for two reasons imo 1) because they want to create something on an emerging platform that hasn&#8217;t been done before and 2) yes we all want to give up our day jobs and play with creating music apps.<br />
Realistically for me 2) will only happen if I keep releasing new apps (less effort to create as you can use an existing framework or library) rather than work on 1 and increase (and lower the volume) or decrease (raising the volume). I&#8217;ve actually found reducing the price does not increase sales. People will buy your app &#8211; after all they spent $1000 on their ipad so collecting as many apps as possible is a must.<br />
For 1) it&#8217;s the only way a developer can survive at the moment &#8211; a labour of love. Compared to my day job I earn 5% of my salary of my day job on one app (which is more than I expected), and spend 70% of a 7 hour day doing that &#8211; not economic.<br />
The route I will take is 3) IAP &#8211; I&#8217;ve release a base app with many functions, but if something larger comes along, its reasonable I think to charge additional for it.<br />
I&#8217;m finding 30% takeup on the IAP I created &#8211; probably low because of another issue (for developers) not mentioned in your article. Marketing. I spent $0 on marketing &#8211; but hope to increase this soon as word of mouth isn&#8217;t good to spread beyond the 2000+ IOS musicians we have here.<br />
So for an indie developer (without the contacts the big companies already have), the biggest problem is deciding how much revenue to spend on marketing. That worries me as we are still niche &#8211; take all the profit out of it and it goes sour &#8211; developer leaves and focuses on other more lucrative areas that aren&#8217;t really serious but generate alot of money&#8230;</p>
<p>I for one have many designs I want to see on the ipad to support the music I create, so will continue to do so&#8230;.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Great article John, it didn&#039;t cover anything I haven&#039;t considered before but it&#039;s great to see it so nicely presented and discussed.

The one aspect of this drive forward that you didn&#039;t mention is the inevitable merger between desktop and mobile operating systems. This has been on the cards for a long time and we&#039;re slowly but surely see these two eco systems come together and I don&#039;t think it will be too long before we can run iOS apps on OS X. That&#039;s a very intriguing, and exciting, thought for me that raises the importance of the questions raised here even higher.

What happens to the pricing model when you can get an iOS app for Â£10 instead of the desktop equivalent at Â£50 - but you can run it on the desktop?

I don&#039;t know the answer ...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Great article -- it&#039;s tough for developers who are hoping to make music apps full time.  I know that I couldn&#039;t live on my app revenue.  It&#039;s my day job that puts food on the table.

My expectation is that many developers will start using bundles as a way to create paid upgrades; I&#039;m planning this for some of my apps.  A bundle could have version 1 of an app, and also version 2.  If a user has version 1, they can get 2 at a discount through the bundle.  New users grab version 2 directly...  And people who are happy with version 1 can stay there as long as they like.  (Hat tip to Bianca -- I saw a comment from her on this, and the light bulb went on).

John&#039;s (4) above -- that&#039;s where I hold out some hope.  We can grow the user base; there&#039;s an ocean of musicians (and potential musicians) who have no idea how good some of the apps are.   Getting the word out through blogs is one avenue.   Psicada touched on another  -- it would be great if more users put reviews into the app store.  I get emails from people telling me how much they like some of my apps; while that&#039;s nice, it would be even better if they put the comments into a review.  Robust reviews give new users confidence that they&#039;re not getting scammed.

Ultimately, developers are slicing up a revenue pie (with Apple taking a 30% slice right from the start).  I&#039;d like to see the pie grow.  I don&#039;t really want to charge more for apps (I like that they can be tried for pocket-change); growing the pie through more users would be fantastic.]]></description>
