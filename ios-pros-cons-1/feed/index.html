Sampletank may note be &quot;Komplete&quot; but it gives me plenty to work with as does Beathawk.. One or two more generations of Cubasis updates and it&#039;ll be a different ballgame , not to mention the rumored upcoming Reason &quot; for iPad.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[reminds me of my G4 powermac...which was SO LOUD there was no way to record anything with it in the room / not in a sound-isolation box...there was no silent option then!

Glad to see this series:  just beginning to put together an iPad-based &quot;music nest&quot; in which to practice and record, so this will be a big help, I&#039;ve no doubt - glad to see you settled into the new site....]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Funny... I didn&#039;t even consider the noise issue. My first desktop-based DAW had fans as loud as a small jet engine. My solution was to run cables out of the studio into a seperate building and put the CPU in there. My most recent DAWs ran very quiet (by design) so it wasn&#039;t an issue. For me it is the convenience of the iPad and iPhone that is the biggest &quot;Pro&quot;. Only recently has it become true that I can do everything I need to do using the iPad alone. My laptop is essentially retired except as a place to store stems and completed projects, and I have a few VSTs that I have no other way to use.]]></description>
