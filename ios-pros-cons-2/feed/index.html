		<description><![CDATA[For quite some time, I&#039;ve had the vision - perhaps nudging towards an obsession! - with the idea of having a recording setup I could pack into a rucksack... and I mean *everything*. Interface; mike(s); mike stand; even extra instruments... That way, I have the potential to produce at least reasonable recordings, wherever I go, if inspiration strikes.

I&#039;m pretty much &quot;there&quot;, actually - I use my iPhone 6S for recording (via a Sonic Port VX), as well as synths, drum-machines, sequencers and FX running on it. Moreover, even my physical musical instruments are increasingly compact: my electric guitar of choice is a Ministar (basically, a neck with pickups), whilst I also often carry around a ukulele or two (including my Risa &quot;stick&quot; electric tenor uke, and Yamaha guitalele). I&#039;ve already recorded a good few projects where everything (or nearly) was laid down on this setup - it just seems to suit my musical style and approach.

That said... this isn&#039;t my *only* studio &quot;facility&quot;: we have a &quot;project studio&quot; at home, based around a Mac and Logic Pro X with &quot;decent&quot; monitors. I hardly ever mix on my &quot;rucksack studio&quot; (unless it&#039;s &quot;rough&quot; mixes for reference) - I prefer to &quot;track&quot; on mobile, but then transfer the material to Logic for overdubs (e.g. software instruments not on the iPhone) and mixing.

In short: I love having a &quot;studio in my pocket&quot; (yes, I can even start songs with no other gear - Garageband and Caustic are favourite apps for this). I can&#039;t do absolutely *everything* on the iPhone, but for me it means at least that I don&#039;t always have to wait to &quot;book time&quot; on our Mac :-)]]></description>
