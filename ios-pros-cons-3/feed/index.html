		<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t think the con of low prices has been adequately addressed here as many music app developers have come and gone over the years because it no longer became worth their while. In general, the more complex an app is, the more time and effort it will take to develop and update it. In addition free updates versus user resistance to new releases of older apps with upgraded features or subscription based approaches means developers often receive little support from the people who use their apps.

Further complicating iOS are Apple&#039;s approaches. The update of iOS is very much a ratcheting process where you can only go forward and never back. This means users have to evaluate the pros and cons of updating their iOS which means their existing setups may not work as expected. It also means developers, given the marginal economics of the App Store, will focus on a few versions of iOS and the newer devices they&#039;re optimized for. In practice this means iOS setups can be a constantly evolving environment where users are having to respond to changes which isn&#039;t conducive to mastering their setups which is a form of iOS overhead which detracts from music creation.

These issues are further compounded by Apple not providing sufficient investment in core music tools like IAA and AU standards to provide the more seamless functionality of laptop or desktop setups which results in more inconsistencies and workarounds which detract from music creation.

I don&#039;t put much credence in app addiction as a reason why iOS is a poor choice for music creation as I believe the issues behind it will simply express themselves in a different yet dysfunctional way in other music creation environments. When an individual is able to manage and cope wth the issues driving their app addiction, I think they&#039;ll make more progress rather than switching to a setup where app addiction isn&#039;t possible in the hopes they&#039;ll be more productive.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think the hardest thing for me on iOS is the difficulty in integration and workflow when compared to a laptop. The other really limiting factor for me is screen size. An affordable iPad with a 9&quot; screen is just too small to comfortably work at speed or with anything of complexity. If you step up to a 12&quot; ipad you are already into MacBook price territory. A lower end MacBook paired with Logic Pro @ $200 I think is a much better price/performance equation than an iPad Pro 12&quot; with a plethora of inexpensive apps. The real thing you lose with the MacBook is the ability to use the screen as a control surface. Note that I have done full songs realized with iOS (https://soundcloud.com/ghmetcalfe/metcalfe-dasa-kodo-midterm), but it is definitely not preferred mode of working. I do however appreciate some of the softsynths and the use of iOS as an adjunct to making music on a laptop.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Alex....  I love the home brew comparison :-) Yes, it is easy to get sucked into an app addiction when each is - relatively speaking - an inexpensive purchase. This is kind of why I&#039;d written at times about the &#039;less is more&#039; approach. The problem for those new to iOS for music tech, however, is knowing which apps to select for their &#039;less&#039; (small compact app collection). I hope the site&#039;s reviews help in some way in that regard, even if only to give readers a better sense of what each app excels at and who it might best suit....  Anyway, best of luck with your own GAS issues....  and thanks for taking the time to share your thoughts....   Best wishes, John]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[A cost-related issue which might be counterintuitive: having access to a large array of low-cost apps means that some of us end up spending more money on apps.
To this day, my most expensive music-related piece of desktop software is Apple’s MainStage (30USD). On my Mac and PC, got a bunch of no-cost stuff including Free Software and “Lite” versions of commercial offerings. On iOS, probably spent way too much money on apps which don’t really stick with me. Altogether, may have spent more money on iOS musicking apps than on one of my iOS devices.

Part of the issue is the lack of trial/demo versions. It’s much easier to avoid impulse purchases when you can try before you buy. Spending 5USD on an app “just to try it” doesn’t sound like such a rational thing to do. And several of the more interesting apps are 20USD and up. With the current CAD-USD exchange rate, it really adds up very quickly.

Another aspect is just plain Gear Acquisition Syndrome. It’s become something of a trope that iOS musickers probably have too many synths, already. We laugh about it and point out to how inexpensive the softsynth-buying habit remains, when compared to hardware purchases. But those of us who’d never really think of buying more hardware synths will buy any softsynth on a whim, without even listening to demos. Easier to break an expensive habit when it’s all up front cost.

And then, there’s the paucity of Free Software on iOS. On the desktop, environments like Sonic Pi, SuperCollider, PureData, ChucK, and Processing all make for very powerful musicking experiences. Very easy to not spend a dime on commercial software when you can have so much fun with these. Completely different situation on iOS. Sure, one could work something out with libPd apps like MobMuPlat and PdParty. But the convenience of inexpensive apps makes it less likely that an iOS musicker would focus on this. Besides, even with Audiobus 3, the whole process of routing MIDI and audio on iOS is such a pain that workflows built on Free Software may not work properly.

Not to mention the peer pressure from fellow iOS users and all of these sites which review neat software. Sure, those exist for desktop platforms as well. But the iOS musicking community is so welcoming (at least to people in my demographic intersection) that it’s easy to get sucked in.

In the abstract, one could imagine a very cost-effective iOS-based musicking setup. Some Audiobus forum members have gone through that exercise. In practice, a lot of iOS musickers keep expanding their setups beyond their needs.

To me, iOS musicking is a bit like homebrewing. Many people start brewing beer to save money. But almost without fail, homebrewers end up spending way more money on beer than they were as beer consumers.]]></description>
