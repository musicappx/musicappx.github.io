TC-11 by bitshape is also a nice synth using touch in a different way. It&#039;s visually pleasing also. Mirror screen to large monitor via Apple TV. Fun for hours.]]></description>

If you were designing a new touchscreen interface then tiny circular knobs are probably the last thing you would want for ease of use and accuracy of parameter changes.

		<description><![CDATA[Still having issues emailing you back replies but this post goes well with your third question about our needs.
What if Apple were to announce 3D Touch (Force Touch) on the iPad, next week?
Glad you mentioned ThumbJam and Animoog. To me, they really take advantage of the touchscreen. On iPhone, ThumbJam supports Force Touch in a very useful way. (Animoog also supports it, AFAICT, but it’s less obvious.) Seaboard 5D is another example, and the whole “Multidimensional Polyphonic Expression” thing (MPE) might really emerge from iOS apps.

And since you talk about tactile feedback, it makes me think about support for “taptic” response. Haven’t heard of a music app which takes advantage of it (and my iPhone 6s Plus has very limited taptic support as compared to the iPhone 7). Yet it’s easy to imagine some virtual sliders and XY pads which make you feel your gestures (knobs are probably less amenable to this kind of haptic/taptic treatment).

And to piggyback on Eric’s point, part of the issue with most iOS apps in terms of UI is that they combine control and sound production. Sure, there are some apps which are only meant as controllers (AC Sabre being a rather interesting case). And Audio Units may eventually pave the way to apps which delegate control to other apps. But most synth apps (and romplers, etc.) devote most of their interfaces to an on-screen virtual keyboard which is very limited in usefulness. For anyone wanting to use an iOS device in performance, it’d make a lot of sense to separate control and sound production.
One way to achieve this could be with separate devices. In this sense, an iPhone running AC Sabre can be a controller for a synth running on an iPad. Or a laptop can drive audio effects running on an iPhone. Not to mention that we can use external MIDI controllers through USB, MIDI, or Bluetooth. (Like Eric, using a 25 key device, on occasion. Been mostly focused on a Wind Controller.)

In my experience, touchscreen devices excel at two types of “control”: innovative ways to send MIDI/OSC messages (à la TouchOSC, ThumbJam, AC Sabre, Animoog, etc.) or ways to tweak multiple aspects of sound at the same time (XY pads, multi-sliders, etc.). Of course, those overlap in that you can use MIDI to modulate a sound. But there’s some usefulness in the conceptual difference between sending notes and doing a filter sweep.

To my eye, the GUIs of most iOS musicking apps remain way too clutter, especially for live performance. As we know from visually impaired users, a touchscreen needs not focus on visual elements. While you’re shredding, you’re usually not looking at your hands. So, having as minimal an interface as possible can actually help iOS musickers quite a bit. The Klevgränd Kanvas GUI may be a step in that direction, but it’s probably not so much of a victory in terms of ergonomy.

Part of the issue, though, might be that the App Store focuses so much on screenshots. An app which only displays two XY pads is less likely to sell than something inspired by the “spaghetti” mess of modular synthesis. Yet, for musicking, we often care more about the sounds we can produce than about having as many virtual buttons, wires, and knobs as possible.

Imagine an app which gives you all the power of Camel Audio’s Alchemy in terms of sound, focused on-screen elements on controlling the sound (with the eight pads and/or some XY pads), supported accelerometer, gyroscope, and 3D Touch, and relied on MIDI input for notes and such. No on-screen keyboard, not even knobs. You prepare your patches before performance and you play by controlling the things it makes sense to control while playing. You could have another app, running on another device, which would focus on notes and “expression”.

In a way, this could be part of a kind of iOS MainStage. 

Not holding my breath. But it’d sure help Apple maintain its dominance in mobile musicking.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I was going to hold back this comment as I suspect you will cover it in a future article. I am currently looking for a way to perform live with the iPad. In my mind I need to connect external controllers and I&#039;m exploring the new crop of mini keyboards that have mini keys and regular size keys but in the 25 key limitation. I also want to connect other midi controllers like the Casio horn and possibly the drumkat, plus a real guitar and I just snagged the irig blueboard. This is my attempt to get over the limitations of a piece of glass as a controller. That being said I totally agree with your comments about how some developers have interfaces that are brilliant for controlling with glass. These are exciting and frustrating times in the Wild West of iOS!]]></description>
