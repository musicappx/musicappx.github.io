		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve been making music on the iPad for six months. When I started I kind of knew what kind of music I wanted to make. I read your blog as a respectful pupil and following your reviews and also from chance encounters elsewhere I purchased the apps, of varying expense or free and tried them out. Some work and some don&#039;t. It&#039;s a very personal thing. The experience of using the app. What I may love working with someone else may not. I can&#039;t stand BlocWaves for example..., but find Samplr essential. 
So I&#039;ve tried a few things out. There is a lot of choice available for iOS users.
Right now I have a very workable collection of apps/instruments/tools.
Modstep, Aum, AudioShare, the Klevgr suite of effects, Ruismaker and Phasemaker, Samplr, Mood and Duplicat (which is a wonderful simple delay tool).
Of course if I knew when I started what I know now I&#039;d have saved a few ££&#039;s.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Having to decide which suit to wear everyday can mess with the mind! :-) Yep, iOS &#039;old timers&#039; (or app addicts) can easily start to get a bit worn out by their choices. Fortunately, there are still some great new releases amongst the regular crop of arrivals....  Best wishes, John]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Great post John.

I am at the point where a new app has to be REALLY special to get me to buy. I just have too many apps to ever use a lot.

I&#039;ve got the same problem with a wardrobe full of navy blue suits...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think the biggest strength of iOS music making is the ability to focus on playing music. The origins of music arose in its universal appeal and its integration into cultures throughout the world and over time. In the last several decades, music has come to be treated as a product to be processed and distributed in much the way we would oil. The strength of iOS is that the barrier to entry both financial and in terms of time are very low for people who can afford an iPhone or iPad. There are a wide variety of musical genres and approaches to creating music represented in apps as well as ways to connect them together such as Audiobus, IAA, AU, MIDI, Link, Bluetooth, wi-fi, USB interfaces, and DAWs.

If people new to music focus on pursuing their musical interest, they can try various apps and setups to discover what works or doesn&#039;t work for them. They can learn new approaches by trying different workflows.

If they should ever decide to record their efforts for distribution to the public, then they&#039;ll need to start addressing the issues raised in the article. The limiting factor will be having music that is compelling enough to warrant the effort needed to record, mix, master, and distribute. Without sufficient quality, it seems there&#039;d be no amount of technical manipulations that would be able to overcome GIGO-- garbage in, garbage out. Too often artists focus on the benefits or needs they hope to get met by achieving high levels of public recognition rather than developing their art.

The process of exploring, learning, and exploring one&#039;s musical expression is a journey with its own merits even if it never reaches the level of professional musician.

Nevertheless, a plethora of inexpensive apps can be a challenge for those struggling with anxiety and fear who focus on trying out too many apps and workflows because it&#039;s a way to put off having to evaluate the quality of their own work. While evaluating ourselves and getting feedback from others can be very helpful, it can also derail us if our expectations are not grounded in the realities of what it takes to develop our musical skills and knowledge at each level rather than being too focused on what accomplished musicians have done without having any insights into how they got there.

In a creative endeavors there are multiple ways to accomplish our goals though I&#039;m dubious of short cuts nor will it be without its ups and downs. Flexibility, perseverance, and a willingness to challenge our own limitations and comfort levels seems essential to making progress. A tool like iOS can certainly facilitate a musician&#039;s development, yet it&#039;s no substitute for developing our own abilities which depends upon how we choose and use our instruments.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Tim.....  thanks for sharing your thoughts. Workflows are, of course, a very personal thing....   but I&#039;m with you all the way that, in the end, it is the final result that matters, not the route my which you get to it. Your listeners don&#039;t hear the equipment list used to make the music....  they hear the music. Best wishes, John]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m definitely in the &quot;ideas station&quot; camp myself, especially as my primary iDevice for recording and music-production is my iPhone. (I should mention that my musical area is generally &quot;singer-songwriter&quot;, blending guitars/ukulele with lo-fi and electronica - think David Kitt, Darren Hayman, &quot;Jack Johnson if he recorded a duo album at his beach home with Brian Eno&quot;, etc. :-) )

My &quot;workflow&quot; is pretty well-settled by now: I almost always begin songs (and often progress them quite far) on the iDevice, then transfer the material to our home Mac/Logic Pro X-based project studio setup for any overdubs (usually synth plugins available on the Mac but not iOS) and mixing. Especially on the iPhone, I feel my DAW apps of choice (MTDAW and Garageband) have pretty poor mixing options, and as long as I have the option of access to Logic and some decent monitors, I don&#039;t feel at all &quot;traitorous&quot; about this &quot;split workflow&quot; method...

In the end, I think it&#039;s &quot;each to their own&quot; - if a musician likes to work end-to-end entirely on an iPad/iPhone and it works for them, then I&#039;m good with that. Maybe I should try it myself one day, and see what I can come up with - thinking about it, I have that Audiomaster Pro subscription to start using ;-)]]></description>
