		<description><![CDATA[I would like to have this one reviewed: AR Synth Music.
I put it on the App Store.  It is a synthesizer on a dollar bill in AR.  I have had a lot of fun with it and am interested in what the pros have to say.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I have started to think that any article that contains &quot;modular synths&quot; and then only mentions Audulus and AnalogKit (which are both great) but forgets to mention SunVox, which has been around for years, exists on all platforms on earth, and is updated at a higher pace than all apps on this list combined (ok, possibly slight exaggeration) is missing something. I consider SunVox to be the original modular synth (/effects unit/sequencer/sampler/whatever) and it is a shame only the new kids no the block get all the glory. :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey Toz, thanks for the fantastic tip on the Yahama Synth Book! This Is one awesome synth. I can&#039;t believe it&#039;s FREE!

It was a real pain to find, though. Yamaha must have gotten word on how great this synth is and have &quot;hidden&quot; it from iPad users --- placing it in the &quot;iPhone only&quot; category (even though it says on the app it works with virtually all idevices.)

For those who are interested in it for iPad, do an App Store search using &quot;all&quot; devices and it should let you download it there. Also, there is a great demo of the app by the guys at The Sound Test Room on YouTube -- just search for &quot;Yamaha Synth Book&quot;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Nlog Synth, is an iOS classic synth which shouldn&#039;t be forgotten, especially by the developer.  I was surprised to see that it hasn&#039;t been updated since Oct, 2014. 

Yamaha Synth Book is a free, universal app with lots of features and it sounds great...although the app has now ballooned in size to 493 MB. 

For the out-there category, and joining their own iVCS3, would be the apesoft synth trio of Stria, iDensity, and iPulsaret.  They are equally weird, but can be lots of fun...Bonus: iDensity updated two days ago.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the time you put into this for us John! Much appreciated. Relieved that this nerd has them all. OK, here is my three cents as a total synth Appaholic. I just love the ambient synth textures that Xythesizr makes. That one is between middle to light weight. Such sonic sublime bliss that. Jordanatron is pretty cool for a mid weight entry and is oft ignored. I have always loooveeeed Crystal Synth, Heaven on an iPad selfie stick that! I think Korg&#039;s iPolysix and iDS-10 should get special mention because they are, special and very, very good solid workhorse apps. BS i16 is pretty freakin awesome and last but not least is Seline Redux Pro recently overhauled and looking and sound fab. There are always more that deserve a shoutout but for now I will draw the line here. Just thought that these bad boys also belonged to the round up. Giddy APP and go!!  Brilliant round up, thank you so very much!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hands up! I took Sunrizer out of the list simply because it is around 18 months since it was last updated....  but, by popular demand, I&#039;ve now added it back in :-) Here&#039;s hoping the app gets some TLC sooner rather than later to ensure it stays current. Best wishes, John]]></description>
