		<description><![CDATA[The sampled pianos are fine but I have found that synthesised pianos are just as good, take up less RAM/HD Space and sometimes better than samples. Modartt make Pianoteq, my current choice of Piano software. I&#039;m hoping it will be morphed over to an iOS version. As an Endorsee, I&#039;m enquiring.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Toz. Yes, I agree, GarageBand and BeatHawk could both be added, along with Yonac&#039;s Steel Guitar, which sounds superb, IMHO. Sadly, by nothing for IOS currently does the trick with regard to human sounding vocals. I asked the blokes at Realitone if they&#039;d port their wonderful Blue singer, but the rep,y was it needs Kontact, and its maker&#039;s seem to have no interest at all in developing an IOS version.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Nice round-up John.  I agree with joaven that CMP Grand should be on the list...really good sounds!  And by the way joaven, I&#039;ve used Module in Cubasis as an IAA instrument driven by a midi track...don&#039;t recall having any problems with that.  

Also the list could include, especially with the recent update, GarageBand.  The new woodwinds and horns instruments sound pretty darn good.  Music Studio also has a good variety of decent sounding orchestral instruments and BeatHawk has a number of sample based sounds available as well.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I &#039;m surprised that CMP grand piano didn&#039;t make it to list. I also have module and iGrand but, to my ear, CMP&#039;s Steinway beats them all. Furthermore, Crudebytes IAA has always worked flawlessly for me. Try using Module in a Cubasis or Auria midi track: it&#039;s not in the instrument list!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the great roundup, John. 
A couple of others:
I find Roland Sound Canvas worth mensioning as an alternative to Sample Tank. Like bsi16 it&#039;s 16 voice multitimbral, and it&#039;s very light on disk-usage, 44.2 mb that is.
Also, for those wishing for MIDI key input for Guitar sound, there is Guitar Capo+.]]></description>
