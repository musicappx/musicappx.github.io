		<description><![CDATA[Hi Tim....   thanks for the kind words.....  Someone mentioned the &#039;pop up blog&#039; concept in an email last week....  and I kind of like that idea. Anyway, that&#039;s kind of what I hope I&#039;ll be able to do....  just &#039;pop up&#039; when something catches my attention...  and maybe a few folks will still be around who want to read it :-)  Anyway, thanks again and very best wishes, John]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Yep, I’m with the other posters here. I kept checking the blog every couple days, even knowing it’s supposed to be dormant. It was a kick to see substantive new posts, and that one of them announces a new synth from Yonac - one of the great iOS developers - was even better.  So thank you sir!

I  was able to get a new synth fix with confidence it would be worth the download - even if I finally had to upgrade from iOS9 to 11 to get it. (I’d been avoiding it for fear of losing some of my beloved older apps, but so far so good.)

 Kauldron may not be a world-beater, but it’s solid, it has a few interesting twists, and among those  900 patches are sure be some to inspire something new. I owe Yonac more than I’ve paid for killer apps like ToneStack, Magellan, Galileo, and KASPAR. I’m never not going to support that level of sustained brilliance. 

Count me in the chorus, John - a couple posts a month (howbout one a week!), especially when there’s new stuff, and life would be so much more complete. The other sites really are dismal, even for very basic information. Deserts. I gave up after trying a few. No one has your touch. 

And you know - you can’t keep your head buried in the production process ALL the time. I bet a break now and then to do something verbal and less tedious will be just what it takes to keep you fresh in both realms of expression. Balance!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Claude, I was even luckier, I got Animoog for .99 Cents when it first released, good times! This app too is for an appaholic like me, a no brainer at this price point. The Spawn 2 button is really fun. John, glad to see you pop back in every so often. I have missed your iOS daily blog but I do understand that there are other fish for you to also fry. So very happy to see you do the occasional major iOS review, it makes my cold turkey withdrawal so much easier on my former daily iOS music blog good habit. Great to see you back even if for a little while. Your written reviews are unmatched in our little iOS music world. My best wishes in all of your future music making projects. Cheers, Susan]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Michael....  Apple have, without making a real fuss about it (which I guess says something about where music making might be amongst their user base and, therefore, advertising priorities), made some interesting tweaks to the AU spec in iOS11. I think the recent Garageband update included support for the new &#039;full screen&#039; format (although I&#039;ve not dug into this as yet)....   while Bram Bos&#039; new Odessa release - alongside AUM - now makes use of the new &#039;MIDI out from AU&#039; feature....  Both of these technical changes are, I think, significant....  but it will take some time for both AU hosts and AU plugins to adopt/adapt to them I guess....  The full screen mode could, potentially, make it much easier for developers to port any complex non-AU apps over to the AU format....   Fingers crossed....  best wishes, John]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I almost knew John would sniff this one out...
so I logged on to Musicappblog, and I was right :)
Kauldron was an instant buy at 60% off introduction price.
Thanks for another interesting review.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This just doesn&#039;t sound that great to me, and I already have at least 5 other virtual analog apps that sound amazing.  I just don&#039;t see the point in spending more money on another 2nd-tier synth just because of it&#039;s whiz-bang AI patch generator.  Maybe more videos will come out that show it&#039;s sound better.]]></description>
