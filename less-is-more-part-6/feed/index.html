		<description><![CDATA[A very good read. I use cubasis too and Beathawk being my drum machine of choice. I import my samples of choices in it through dropbox, the only small issue is you have to import sound by sound, there is no option to import several sounds at the same time like lets say BM3. Or perhaps i overlooked something.
Regarding Au units its already fantastic to have all those tools, thanks for the article]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I feel I have to update my listing above, since I&#039;ve finally acquired Enkl. 
What I have found with my discovery of Klevgrand apps is that they maybe simple on the surface but they offer an audio dynamic that suits my needs and wants. I make minimal techno/dub/ambient soundscapes. With Klevgrand they offer one thing per appstrument tool and do it very well and what I find is one of the most essential things in using an instrument be it software or hardware is that you actually enjoy the experience of using the thing, and this is what I love about Klevgrand and now particularly Enkl. The extended keyboard is a finger dancing delight. And of course it sounds wonderful.
My basic tool kit begins with either Aum or Modstep. Then I add the effects. These are mostly Klevgrand and also the delightful Duplicat.

This is a wonderful series John. It&#039;s interesting to have your views and your readers.
Keep it going.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I have really been enjoying the AU format and the ease of use it provides when it comes to recording directly into your chosen DAW. My hope is that it becomes a staple feature with the release of each new music app, and hopefully more of the &quot;old favorites&quot; will eventually follow suit.
With regards to a guitar amp sim with AU functionality, I would suggest Tonebridge (a free app from UltimateGuitar) as a possible candidate. While not as feature-heavy or in depth as some of the previously mentioned guitar amp sims (guitar is not my primary instrument), it does a great job of providing 100s of guitar tone presets from various genres that sound surprisingly good.. think SynthMaster Player, but for guitar. It works as an AU FX plugin within your chosen DAW so you have to choose an amp sim within your DAW and then apply Tonebridge as a plugin effect and choose your tone preset. This works more accurately if you apply a preset on top of a cleaner tone, however the fact that it works this way does allow for a lot of interesting results. One of my favorite things to do is apply different guitar tones to synth sounds (or any and all sounds.. including symphonic orchestra...yes it&#039;s weird) and jam out some guitar solos on my external midi keyboard. 
I was quite surprised when I did a search on the blog and didn&#039;t find a review of Tonebridge. If you haven&#039;t tried it out I would be interested in hearing your thoughts as I&#039;m no expert when it comes to guitar amps. :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Modstep for sequencing a beat/sound, I find Modstep works for me to synth and drum.
Aum to host and mix and record
Haaze
Svep
Duplicat
Presslt 
Kovpressor
Squashlt 
Esspresso 
Mood
Syndt
Ruismaker
Phasemaker
iDensity
And as my none AU tool -  Kluvert!! :))
Yeah I&#039;m a Klevgrand fan. They just do something magical, in a very Deep KISS way.

Oh, yes, if you&#039;re counting it&#039;s only fifteen. I&#039;m still waiting for Kymatica to make they&#039;re effects AU, especially Oscillator.]]></description>
