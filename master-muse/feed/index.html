		<description><![CDATA[:-) Sorry....   it&#039;s not as bad as it looks....   all the same email gets onto my iPad/iMac also and that&#039;s where it gets looked at and dealt with mostly....   And don&#039;t forget, it includes notification of every bit of spam comment fluff that &#039;bots&#039; hit the website with. I&#039;ve really got to get a better system for dealing with that :-)  best wishes, John]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Interesting article. I dont have iphone but I do have an ipad so doesnt really apply. I will say that a streamlined approach is sensible I generally stick with bs16i paino straight into Meteor DAW or mazybe acoustic guitar into Loopy. Keeping it simple is key (sorry &#039;bout that).

* One thing is really bothering me about this article though. Please can you clear you inbox on your emails its creeping me out? :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This is exactly the kind of reason I love having a smart phone. Its wonderful to quickly take notes, record a sound I like, or take pics of something that inspires me. Personally, my iOS app (yes, app singular) for this is Nanoloop. You can do a bit of everything with it, and most importantly, I&#039;m used to it. Which is probably the most important thing; you don&#039;t want to be fumbling around when you got an idea in your head.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Glad to see iphone as go-to in this article.... Oddly enough, I find iphone to be a great format for performance. Using thumbjam constrained to scale, can make for great melodic improvisation . Using the tilt and roll ( accelerometer ) input to control synths has also been quite useful on iphone.
Thanks John]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Chris....  thanks for the kind words. I guess what I&#039;m suggesting here is not that we delete all the other (excellent) stuff...  but just that for this very specific task of capturing the essence of an initial idea, the &#039;bare bones&#039; software is actually all you need. Once captured - and when you have the time and inclination - these initial ideas can be turned into a fully-developed production using anything you might care to throw at it :-)  Again, thanks and very best wishes, John]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I really need to address the insane overload of apps on my iPad, and even the stuff on my desktop. Too much stuff getting in the way of the creative roll seems to be a very big theme of late in a lot of articles I have been reading about blocks in getting the actual music done.

I like your choices here. They reflect an awareness of what the bread and butter sounds, instruments, and layering choices we have for making good old fashioned songs, and really, so much more with a healthy dose of imagination and attitude thrown into the mix. Having said that, after discovering things like Sector, Turnado, Nave, Animoog, IVCS3, it may be a tall order to &quot;get back to basics&quot; for a lot of us...you as well, I imagine;)...

Great, timely article, as per usual, John.

Cheers!]]></description>
