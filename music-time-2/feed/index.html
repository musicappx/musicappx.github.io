		<description><![CDATA[Hi John,
I&#039;m a bit late with this post but I still check in here from time to time to see if you&#039;ve posted anything. I came into the iOS music app buying craze just as it was getting going and my two favorite sites were MAB and The Sound Test Room. It makes me smile to think about ALL those wonderful apps (that I STILL use) and the times we all had waiting for the next great app. More than just great apps and great music being made with them, the whole &quot;epoch&quot; was so much fun! It was one of those eras that will likely never be repeated, at least not to the degree that this was. My buddy and I refer to this as the &quot;Animoog&quot; era ;) I hope you continue to post to this blog and perhaps a few new groundbreaking apps  come about in the mean time. I wish you all the best and Thank You for the years that you have been a BIG voice in the  iOS music app era. I feel like I know you ;)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[B-I-A-B would, I think, work well on an iPad....   It&#039;s quite a while since I used it and perhaps my main observation from memory would be that the GUI is a touch on the busy side to work on a smaller iPad screen.....  Still, it would be interesting to see :-) . Very best wishes, John]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I still keep MAB in my feed-reader, as it&#039;s always good to hear from you when you drop by here :-) Glad to hear the library music is going well - nothing wrong with this avenue... one of my musical heroes, Anthony Phillips (a great guitarist and composer, and a founder member of Genesis) now carries out much of his activity as a library music composer and producer.

Yes, iOS music apps do seem to have reached a &quot;cruising speed&quot;, although there can still be surprises... like Moog Music launching their new Minimoog Model D universal app for iOS yesterday, clean out of the blue! Just like they did with Model 15 almost two years ago...

Anyway: great to hear from you - thanks for all the great &quot;heads-up&quot; you&#039;ve given us until now, and all the best with your next projects!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Good to hear from you, John. While I&#039;m glad that you are pursuing your real passion I must say, selfishly, that I do miss your activity on what was or, rather, still is, my fav music blog. I agree with you that app development seems to have peaked, at least from the types we have seen in the past. 

I&#039;m still hoping for some facsimile of Band In A Box, though. Think it could be a massive hit. 

All the best,

Bob]]></description>
