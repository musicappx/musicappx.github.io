		<description><![CDATA[People saying HW lasts longer than SW are wrong. Nothing prevents you to not upgrade your iPad or ios and still use your beloved app. Same with desktop and laptops. It’‘s just that with computers you can do so much you are pushed to think you have to upgrade. When you buy a HW synth, you do it without thinking you’re gonna upgrade it. Why not thinking the same with say iPad 2 with Animoog ?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I find Apple hardware to be the longest lasting, most reliable, sustainable devices - period!

My iPhone 5S is still going strong at 4 years old and showing no signs of becoming unusable any time soon, iPad Air is fantastic for making music, but then I stopped updating it on iOS 9 and just put up with the sociopathic reminders to update every single time I use it and that maybe I can&#039;t have the latest and greatest - but so what? Mac Book Air 3 &#038; 1/2 years old and going strong on Mavericks! I do not expect to replace any of these devices for as long as I possibly can. I am seriously expecting another 2 to 3 years.

So, yes, it&#039;s a people issue - the greedy shareholders wanting more profit all the time so they can stuff their faces getting fat at other peoples expense. In turn this necessitates the relentless psychological warfare waged by the manufacturers to impose a sense of lack in the unsuspecting public that makes them think that they have to have the latest gadget because their old one isn&#039;t good enough any more... and the the public themselves for being so damn gullible.

I was happy to see that the iPhone 8 queues were virtually non-existent - maybe this is a good sign that things will start to change - lets hope so because if we all carry on like this we will most definitely be totally screwed in a few years time as materials simply become unavailable  :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This whole post starts discussing the iPad air 2 and I think its based on the wrong foundations, some guys on the audiobus forum (and to some extent the Facebook group) get really paranoic about every little detail eventually seeing so many things that aren&#039;t even there... The iPad air 2 its completely fine for anything music related. This slowdown of old devices its coming to an end already, iOS 11 barely changes the speed of old devices compared to iOS 10 and iOS 10 from iOS 9 was the same. Barely changed anything speed wise.

Maybe its the trauma that was going from iOS 6 to iOS 7 and then iOS 8, (which were pretty rough on pro users of iOS)
But some people go really crazy about updates.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&#039;The whole Laptop/iDevice thing just pisses me off as it is out of date within a year and I have to chuck it.&#039;

I disagree. IMHO this only has to do with shifting expectations. My iPad 3 with Samplr still runs fine.

Back in the day if you&#039;d bought a DX7 you&#039;d also need to &#039;upgrade&#039; for the shiny D50. And the M1 a year or two later. For a lot of cash. But only if you feel you &#039;have to chuck it&#039;.

That&#039;s simply progress. If anything, the whole software revolution made the upgrade bar a lot lower.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Over time, the problem will fix itself.
Someone mentioned the fact that desktops last longer nowadays, and this is true -- but in the past, a 4-year old computer would be completely outdated as well. Remember: In 1985 there was Windows 1.0, in 1990, you would use Windows 3.0; in 1995, Windows &#039;95 came out.
Nowadays, the speed increases on processor level for desktops/laptops are not that impressive. I like the fact that I can use my hardware longer.
We are not there yet on mobile. With the A11 chip Apple managed again to cram much more processing power in the SoC. When they released the iPad2 with the A5 chip, I thought that was massive. Compared to the A11, it is absolutely nothing.
I see this period as a transition period, in a few years from now we will have the same situation as we have with pc&#039;s; and let&#039;s hope Apple will shift iPad/iPhone releases to a 2-year cycle.
With regard to software prices: don&#039;t forget that the low prices enabled many people - like me - to discover music making on the iPad. If Nanostudio would have been 30 euros, I would never have started with it. I hope there will be a market always for the little apps like Caustic, Sunvox. I have noticed that there is already a tendency for price increases with new releases, which is fine with me, but as I said, it is important to have some simple apps as well.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I have to go with Bram on that. I guess I&#039;ve been into the ipad from the very beginning as far as music is concerned. Between Mr. Walden&#039;s Music App Blog and the Soundtest Room, I have over 300 apps. You&#039;re right. How much do I really use? 

But I do have my favorites workhorses. Cubasis, iMaschine, Audiobus, Launchpad, Blocs Wave, Beathawk, Sythnmaster, Chordbot and I really like Trouble Maker. When I&#039;m standing on the subway, it&#039;s iMaschine, and Trouble Maker. When I can get a seat... 

The reason I like these apps is for what you stated and why Japan was able to change its image from a copy cat, cheap tricks, Really? kind of a nation in the 1960&#039;s to a world leader in High End Good Quality Technological products as a nation!

They did exactly what you said. They took a great idea and made it 20 times better. And on the way, it triggered the creative process and evolved into new product lines pretty much with TroubleMaker hitting the scene followed up by RippleMaker. Then the Random feature in TroubleMaker and RippleMaker had scales and keys! How rad is that? 

I can see it in the other members of my band who think the ipad is a piece of crap. Meanwhile, I can see it in their eyes, &quot;How did he come up with that?&quot; 

I also think that the music industry is in a dilemma. A lot of Bigtime software manufacturers like NI, Ableton, Korg, Propellerhead and Steinberg treat the ipad like a toy and I understand the reasoning. I&#039;m selling Cubase for $400 - $600 on the MacBook and Cubasis for $50 on the ipad. Of course, I&#039;m not giving you the same functionality but what happens when the ipad becomes robust enough to support a fully featured version of it&#039;s Macbook Model? What happens when the code becomes seamless between platforms? Different platform... same price. What happens when the functionality of the ipad exceeds the Macbook from an innovative perspective? Korg already copied Gadget from the pad to the pro... 

Bram, thanks for sharing and John thanks for letting him.]]></description>
