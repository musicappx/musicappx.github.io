		<description><![CDATA[ha there John you know I really wish I could understand 90% of the stuff you have been writing about
in these articles. don&#039;t get me wrong they are great. so in English what types of music can be produces from these devices.  I have for years been looking for the technology that allows individual piano players to play full studio versions of their favorite songs,  basically filtering out the piano notes and the lead voice.  you might say a great karaoke machine that eliminates the voice unlike karaoke(voice slightly in background) lol, as well as allowing the piano player to play the entire piano piece. I do love my music but I am not one that see&#039;s myself being able to play with a full band. I am one of those people that are not a team player. oh well thanks for your gr8 post articles.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi jStall...  thanks for this and glad it has helped in some way. There are all sorts of opinions about the relative merits of different sample rates and bit depths but the pragmatist in me is more than happy to stick with 24-bit/44.1kHz for the vast majority of the work I do... I can see the argument for higher &#039;quality&#039; when you have (a) the budget) and (b) the recording environment to justify it...  but for most home/project recording - even when the end product is for commercial use - I think that resolution is plenty good enough providing you take care of the rest of the elements in the signal chain. best wishes, John]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This was a really good read as I&#039;m currently recording Guitar, Bass and Vocals with a Sonic Port VX with great results. Sonic port vx is 24/48khz so I&#039;ve been researching extensively for higher kHz recording capability. I didn&#039;t notice at first but I believe ios garage band only captures in 16 bit, in fact most programs it seems you need to select 24 bit and the khz. I&#039;m looking at Apogee Duet 24/192khz and it looks like most ios programs I&#039;ve researched cut off recording at 96khz. So I guess there is no need for a $600. 192khz interface at this time as I don&#039;t own a mac. I&#039;m still learning but I can tell you I&#039;ve had several compliments on my recordings. When I tell people I&#039;m doing it on a ipad air 2 they are shocked.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&#039;contrast for those just getting into music technology now compared to where we were at 20, 10 or even 5 years ago.&#039;

I think another big reason and is never really talked about is the ease of actually of buying the iPad and all the apps. You don&#039;t even need to leave the house, Have a studio delivered to the house in a box, then get online, browse 100s of music apps. 10 mins later have several music app.

10-20 year you had to go to STORES, or see in a magazine or word of mouth whats hot,  New hardware or were to buy. etc.

The creation of music is final hitting the point in technology that Graphic Design did or Photography.
Now anyone can have the tools to do it now.....but that doesn&#039;t mean everyone is good at it.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the feedback.....  I&#039;ve commented before about the pricing model on the App Store. As a consumer, I love it but, as iOS gradually plays catch up with the desktop, you do wonder whether something will have to give somewhere....  I&#039;m currently working on a related project that looks at costing up an complete iPad-based studio....  and the software cost is really interesting (and very different) from building a desktop system....  You are right about &#039;grunt&#039; though. There, the desktop currently wins hands down....

Finally, forgive me if I do my best to stop iOS music production from being a secret :-)  I like getting readers to the website too much....]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Good article, far too many folks are dismissive of iOS and this is completely unjustified!

With Nave, Auria, iSEM, Lemur and yes Loopy etc... we&#039;re in the fortunate position of having superb quality musical instruments literally in our pockets! It&#039;s a wonderful time to be a musician and I actually feel sorry for any musicians who are missing out because of their misconceptions, you&#039;re right though, they will catch on eventually :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I agree about sound quality inside the box with  IOS ...it&#039;s fine...and the audio chain outside the box is important  whatever system you use.For me the main difference is the sheer grunt of a desk top which would let me run say Kontakt ,Diva,more software outboard than you can shake a stick and a DAW at the same time .
    But....I find the iPad more involving....the touch screen and interesting software means I work in a different way....and the fact the apps are so cheap means I can buy anything that looks interesting and see if it suits me.
   That&#039;s huge,let&#039;s say Windows stuff is £100 a go...if I invest in a couple a year I feel the need to use them....even when I find them less intuitive than I want and the effort to result ratio disappointing .But on my iPad I recently bought Turnado,I didn&#039;t like it....so I don&#039;t use it...whereas as I swear by Loopy .This is a huge freedom and is allowing me a much a more personal collection of software.
    Finally I admire your crusading spirit,after all it gives me this excellent blog ....but I don&#039;t much mind IOS being underrated ...it&#039;s rare for me to have the drop on my geeky brethren  ...long may it stay that way :)]]></description>
