There&#039;s not much I can do about that from my end unless Apple bring the feature to older iOS versions too (which is not very likely to happen).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Eric i believe you will lose alchemy in the ios11 update even if others update to 64, apple ruined alchemy :(   Im not updating my ipad 4 ever, im keeping my alchemy the way it was, i will update the other ipads when i know for absolute sure every single part of my workflow is improved not BROKE.  So that will be a while i guess, i dont really care, because there had to be a time when i finally bought all i need to make my music...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ah so ios11. I&#039;m not ready to go there. I&#039;m afraid of losing all my 32 bit apps. But I haven&#039;t done the research yet to see if this is true. I have homework to do!]]></description>
