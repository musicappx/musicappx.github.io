		<description><![CDATA[Excellent list, John, but you might want to correct a couple of typos where Phonem is referred to as  &quot;Phenom&quot;.

All the best for 2017, and keep up the good work.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think apeSoft and the Amazing Noizes developers need a special mention: they&#039;ve updated their apps, added Link and AU to many of them, and significantly upgraded/updated the features/functions in many of them too as well as maintaining a degree of GUI familiarity across the apps. I hope Moebius Lab eventually gets an update so it supports AU apps too. If you like creating music outside of the box, then these developers and their apps are definitely worth looking into.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s hard to argue with John&#039;s list, although I only have 4 of the listed apps.  My app purchasing is down this year (way down from all previous years), but I&#039;m very happy and productive with what I have.  For me, Model 15 was the top new app of 2016. 

As mentioned, a top list of best app updates of 2016 could be fun topic; my favorite is Cubasis2.]]></description>
