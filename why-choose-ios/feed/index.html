		<description><![CDATA[Hi David....  it&#039;s great that iOS has enabled you to get back into music creation. Did you actually &#039;give away&#039; a Juno 60 though? Way back when, I owned a Juno 6 and have always regretted parting with it...  I&#039;ll not tell you what alternative keyboard I bought with the money it raise as it is just too embarrassing :-(  best wishes, John]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Kieran, Yeah sure there&#039;s examples, Discchord frequently feature bands that utilise iOS (there was a really good one a few weeks ago with a female singer - search Tims archives) then there&#039;s bands like the flaming lips etc that have experimented with iOS in the past, it wouldn&#039;t surprise me if Radiohead incorperate iOS in future as they&#039;re really into experimenting with electronic sounds. As for &#039;enhancing&#039; their music, I&#039;m not so sure about that, it&#039;s more just a bands choice to incorperate alternative/cutting edge technology into their music (rather than the same ubiquitous hardware) whether it&#039;s using iOS as a control surface (such as lemur) or using a synth that adds a distinctive sound like Animoog etc. Just google iOS music I&#039;m sure you&#039;ll locate some acts! Regarding live use, I really wish IOS had a &#039;direct mode&#039; that switched off all background tasks, and gave direct control to the current software running as sometimes it randomly has little glitches (probably memory allocation) which doesn&#039;t inspire confidence, but people use it and seem to pull it off fine! I must admit I&#039;ve always wondered if any band has been brave enough to perform around an IOS click track? iOS isn&#039;t know for its timing (understatement) but it&#039;s possible Ableton link has changed that!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Are there examples on YouTube of solo acoustic musicians or bands who are successfully using iOS to greatly enhance their sound, especially during live performance, that doesn&#039;t involve spending significant money? I&#039;d love to see  examples of all of this great software being put into action. Thanks.]]></description>
